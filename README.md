# Visualization-and-localization-system-of-key-points-for-the-CERC-Kinshasa-project-of-the-World-Bank

## Project Overview and Context
The Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has obtained funding from the
World Bank of USD 695 million to finance the “STEP 2” Project,
additional funding 2 and 3 to the Eastern DRC Stabilization for Peace Project (“STEP”). The
Ministry of Finance, the project’s supervisory authority, has signed a Subsidiary Agreement with the DRC Social Fund (FSRDC) for the implementation of the activities.
This social protection project aims to improve access to livelihoods and socio-economic
infrastructure in vulnerable communities in the country. For more information: https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P171821
The project includes an emergency response component, which will enable the Government to address the socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic, through the implementation of an emergency cash transfer (CTP) program in the city of Kinshasa. The “Solidarity through Economic Transfers against Poverty in Kinshasa” (STEP-KIN) program will be financed to the tune of USD 50 million over a period of 12 months and will target approximately 250,000 beneficiaries. The transfer amount will be USD 25 per month for six months for each beneficiary of the program.

For the success of the said project, I was asked to set up the necessary tools for the localization and visualization of the various key points useful for the execution of the CERC project but also important for the VBG/EAS/HS project.

## Stakeholders
• The World Bank (donor)

• Project beneficiaries

• Project specialists

• Complaints management mechanism assistant

• Environmental and social safeguard assistants

• The visual producer

• Field teams

• The call center

## Operation

• The environmental and social safeguard assistants with the field team collected and recorded the data from the various key points on the ground in a Google Sheet file.

• This file served as an online data source for our visual. This makes our visual dynamic because it directly updates the data saved by the field team during the field visits.



## Visual presentation

### 1. Definition

It is a visual designed with Power BI that allows you to transform the raw data collected by the AS into a comprehensive and easily exploitable visual.

### 2. What are the benefits it brings us?
• The tool gives us total accessibility to our spatial data from anywhere. We can access the visual no matter where we are with our phone, tablet or laptop.

• It allows us to easily analyze our data and use it for good decision-making.

• It allows us to convert our raw data into simple visuals, visuals that will then be easily exploited.

• The tool allows you to visualize each element as a whole to make a more informed decision.

• The tool allows us to manipulate our information in an interactive and dynamic way, such as to produce analyses such as the exact location of different points on a map, the number of places collected, the places according to different municipalities, the rates of the places of the points collected.

### 3. What are the disadvantages ?

• The tool is not free, the use of the tool requires certain prerequisites such as the purchase of a Power BI pro license (€8.40/user payable monthly)

• The Tool allows you to process and visualize data in the form of graphs but does not allow you to modify the source data. If you want to modify a data, you must do so in the source file.

### 4. Use cases of visual in the project ?
The system can be used for several cases including:

• In the event of a change in the allocation of AS by municipality, the system will allow the new AS assigned to the municipality to easily find his way around while using the data collected by the one who preceded him, which will make his task easier and save him time.

• The tool will allow the Call Center (CA) team to guide a beneficiary on the move who would like to withdraw cash in a given neighborhood but does not know where to do so, the system will allow the CA team to be able to guide the latter to the nearest cash point.

• Help the entire project team during field trips to plot an itinerary or during the visit to locate target points (such as the location of offices in the neighborhood)

• Help specialists to find different hot spots in different municipalities if it is necessary to deploy information points for popularizing the USSD code or raising awareness of VBG/SEA/HS

• And many other uses


### 5. Features
The visual offers several features such as:

• **Data filtering by municipality** : Allows you to filter data by categorizing it by municipality and represents on a map the location point of each data in its respective municipality.

• **Data filtering by location** : Allows you to filter points by location
(Neighborhood office, Cash point, Town hall and Hot spot). Displaying for example all the cash points located in the chosen municipality while hiding the other points that are not cash points.

• **Map** : Allows you to represent points from geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) on a Microsoft Map by differentiating them with different colors.

• **Display statistical graphs** : Allows you to display the numbers and rates (in percentage) of places collected from different targeted municipalities or neighborhoods. Displays in the form of a grouped histogram the numbers of points or places collected for each municipality.

• **Display the names and comments** : Displays the name of the AS that collected the data as well as the comments (observations) characteristics of the point.

### 6. Compatibility
The visual is accessible via the web. That is to say it can work on all operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Android, etc.), you just need a web browser.
But it is also accessible in application version on Windows, Android, Ios.

### 7. Test project

#### 1. Clone the Repository: 
```bash 
git clone <repository_url>
```
#### 2. Build the Project:

• Install Microsoft PowerBI
• Open Microsoft Power BI
• Open with Microsoft Power BI the file "Projet BI FSRDC.pbix" that you just cloned. (File -> Open -> Browse this device -> Go to the location where you cloned the file "Projet BI FSRDC.pbix" and Select this file -> Open)


**Ce visuel a été adapté par la suite pour les répérages des hopitaux, centres de santé et des entités à caractères protections de genre et droits de l'enfant (Orphelinat, S/ciat, parquets,  etc.) pour le projet VBG/EAS/HS.**
